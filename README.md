# -Density-based-smart-traffic-control-system

This project is a smart traffic control system that uses the Canny edge detection algorithm to manage traffic signal timings based on vehicle density. The system aims to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion by dynamically adjusting the green signal time according to real-time traffic conditions.

Features:

Real-Time Vehicle Detection: Uses Canny edge detection to identify and count vehicles in traffic camera feeds.

Dynamic Signal Timing: Allocates green signal time based on the detected vehicle density.

Traffic Flow Optimization: Reduces congestion and improves traffic efficiency.

Technologies Used:

Algorithm: Canny Edge Detection

Programming Language: [Specify language, e.g., Python]

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy

Hardware: [Specify if applicable, e.g., Traffic Cameras]

Backend: [Specify backend technology if any, e.g., Node.js]

Frontend: [Specify frontend technology if applicable, e.g., React.js]

Deployment: [Specify deployment platform if any]


Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed
Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
